ok so the story is at least coherent now which is good but something feels off. i uploaded an image of me and friend and chose "rom-com" below is the story that Gorlea gave me. my first issue with the story is that Gorlea seemed to describe the characters wrong. Gorlea said that my friend's character had a yellow dress? and that I had brown hair? i don't mind Gorlea making up names and stretching things but it should still make the user feel llike Gorlea used their image to create a story, just from me reading this story i'm not even sure if the AI actually analyzed the image of if it just generated a story based on me clicking the rom com button. any just give me your honest thoughts on Gorlea's story compared to the image that i uploaded (see attached) 

Gorlea's story:

It was a sunny morning at Rosie’s Diner. The round tables gleamed, and the smell of fresh coffee floated in the air. In the center of the room, two people sat across from each other. Mia wore a bright yellow dress and a big smile. Kyle, with a messy head of dark hair, tapped his fingers nervously on the table.

Mia glanced at his pancakes. They were stacked high, dripping with syrup, and someone had made a happy face on top with blueberries and whipped cream. She laughed. “You ordered the Happy Stack again?”

Kyle grinned. “Best way to start the day.”

Rosie, the friendly waitress, came over with a wink. “Anything else for you two lovebirds?” Her silver hair bounced as she set down fresh orange juice.

Kyle went red. “Uh, not lovebirds. We’re just—”

Mia interrupted with a giggle, “We’re just friends, Rosie.”

“Oh, sure you are,” Rosie said, walking away.

Kyle tried to change the subject. “Big plans today, Mia?”

Mia shrugged. “Laundry. Groceries. Maybe I’ll watch a movie tonight. You?”

He stared at his pancakes. “Something important. But I’m kind of nervous.”

Mia leaned closer. “What is it?”

Before Kyle could answer, Rosie popped back over and handed Mia a small plate. On it was a single golden pancake, shaped like a heart.

Mia stared at it. “What’s this?”

Rosie covered her mouth. “Oops\! That’s not yours, honey.” But she winked at Kyle.

Kyle coughed. “Actually, I asked Rosie for… um… some help.”

Mia’s eyes grew wide.

Kyle took a deep breath. “Mia, we’ve been friends for years. We eat pancakes together almost every Saturday.” He looked down, smile shy. “I was hoping you’d go on a real date with me.”

Mia’s cheeks turned pink. She laughed, the sound bright as sunshine.

“I was waiting for you to ask\!” she said, picking up the heart pancake.

Kyle’s nervous frown turned into a huge grin. Everyone in the diner clapped—even Rosie.

“Looks like you two finally figured it out\!” Rosie cheered.

They shared the heart pancake. Mia drew a happy face with syrup on Kyle’s next pancake, and he wrote her name in whipped cream.

From that Saturday on, Mia and Kyle became the diner’s favorite couple. And every week, Rosie made two heart pancakes instead of one.
