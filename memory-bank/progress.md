# Progress: Gorlea Snaps

## What Works

- Project brief, product context, system patterns, and tech context are fully documented in the Memory Bank.
- Initial project structure and documentation are in place.
- Core frontend technologies and architecture are defined.
- Environment setup is complete (Node.js, Git, Firebase CLI).
- Repository setup is complete (cloned, dependencies installed, environment variables configured).
- Firebase services (Authentication, Firestore, Storage) are enabled in the Firebase Console.
- Firebase package is installed with all necessary type declarations.
- Firebase initialization file is created and configured with environment variables.
- Password reset email template is configured in Firebase Authentication.
- Firestore database schema is defined with collections for users, stories, and favorites.
- Firestore security rules are configured to protect user data.
- Firebase Storage security rules are configured for image uploads.
- Firebase Storage is successfully implemented for story image uploads.
- OpenAI GPT-4.1 integration is implemented for story generation.
- Story generation with AI and image upload is working correctly.

## What's Left to Build

- Implement real authentication using Firebase Authentication.
- Implement frontend authentication, image upload, genre selection, and story generation.
- Develop user profile, favorites management, and drawer components.
- Optimize performance, error handling, and testing.
- Deploy to Vercel and configure production environment.

## Current Status

- Memory Bank documentation is established and being updated.
- Environment setup is complete.
- Firebase project "gorlea-snaps" is set as the active project.
- Firebase services (Authentication, Firestore, Storage) are enabled in the Firebase Console.
- Firebase initialization file is created and configured.
- Firebase Storage is successfully implemented for story image uploads.
- OpenAI GPT-4.1 integration is implemented for story generation.
- Story generation with AI and image upload is working correctly.
- Project is in the implementation phase.
- Authentication using Firebase Authentication is implemented.

## Known Issues

- Security and performance optimizations to be addressed during development.
- Firebase Storage security rules are currently set to be permissive for development; need to be tightened for production.
- Need to implement proper error handling for image uploads.
- Need to ensure all Firebase SDK operations are used for storage operations to avoid CORS issues.
- OpenAI API key needs to be properly secured in production environment.
