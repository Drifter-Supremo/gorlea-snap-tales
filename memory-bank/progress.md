# Progress: Gorlea Snaps

## What Works

- Project brief, product context, system patterns, and tech context are fully documented in the Memory Bank.
- Initial project structure and documentation are in place.
- Core frontend technologies and architecture are defined.
- Environment setup is complete (Node.js, Git, Firebase CLI).
- Repository setup is complete (cloned, dependencies installed, environment variables configured).
- Firebase services (Authentication, Firestore, Storage) are enabled in the Firebase Console.
- Firebase package is installed with all necessary type declarations.
- Firebase initialization file is created and configured with environment variables.
