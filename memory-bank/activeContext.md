- Moving from setup to implementation phase.
- Preparing to connect the application to Firebase services.

## Recent Changes

- Completed all environment setup tasks (Node.js, Git, Firebase CLI).
- Set "gorlea-snaps" as the active Firebase project.
- Completed repository setup (installed dependencies, created .env.local file).
- Added Firebase configuration and OpenAI API key to environment variables.
- Verified that Firebase services (Authentication, Firestore, Storage) are enabled in the Firebase Console.
- Created Firebase initialization file (`src/lib/firebase.ts`) with proper configuration.

2. ✅ Update the AuthContext to use Firebase Authentication instead of mock data.
3. ✅ Implement sign up functionality using Firebase Authentication.
4. ✅ Implement login functionality using Firebase Authentication.
5. ✅ Implement password reset functionality using Firebase Authentication.
6. ✅ Implement profile picture upload functionality.
7. ✅ Remove guest access mode.
8. ✅ Add protected routes for authenticated users.
9. ✅ Add logo to the application and set as favicon.
10. [ ] Set up Firestore collections structure and security rules.
11. [ ] Configure Firebase Storage security rules.

## Active Decisions and Considerations

- We are using the "gorlea-snaps" Firebase project, which is now set as the active project.
- We're taking a step-by-step approach, completing and checking in after each task.
- Documentation will continue to be updated as the project evolves.
- We'll focus on one phase at a time, ensuring each component is properly implemented before moving on.
