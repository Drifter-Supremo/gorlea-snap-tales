# Active Context: Gorlea Snaps

## Current Work Focus

- Preparing for Firebase integration and configuration.
- Moving from setup to implementation phase.
- Setting up Firebase services for the application.

## Recent Changes

- Completed all environment setup tasks (Node.js, Git, Firebase CLI).
- Set "gorlea-snaps" as the active Firebase project.
- Completed repository setup (installed dependencies, created .env.local file).
- Added Firebase configuration and OpenAI API key to environment variables.
- Updated documentation to reflect completed tasks.

## Next Steps

1. Initialize Firebase in the project using `firebase init`.
2. Configure Firebase Authentication, Firestore, and Storage.
3. Begin implementing Firebase integration in the frontend.

## Active Decisions and Considerations

- We are using the "gorlea-snaps" Firebase project, which is now set as the active project.
- We're taking a step-by-step approach, completing and checking in after each task.
- Documentation will continue to be updated as the project evolves.
- We'll focus on one phase at a time, ensuring each component is properly implemented before moving on.
