# Active Context: Gorlea Snaps

## Current Work Focus

- Implementing Firebase integration in the frontend code.
- Moving from setup to implementation phase.
- Preparing to connect the application to Firebase services.

## Recent Changes

- Completed all environment setup tasks (Node.js, Git, Firebase CLI).
- Set "gorlea-snaps" as the active Firebase project.
- Completed repository setup (installed dependencies, created .env.local file).
- Added Firebase configuration and OpenAI API key to environment variables.
- Verified that Firebase services (Authentication, Firestore, Storage) are enabled in the Firebase Console.
- Created Firebase initialization file (`src/lib/firebase.ts`) with proper configuration.
- Installed Firebase package (`npm install firebase`) to resolve type declaration issues.
- Configured password reset email template in Firebase Authentication.
- Updated documentation to reflect completed tasks.

## Next Steps

1. Implement real authentication using Firebase Authentication.
2. Update the AuthContext to use Firebase Authentication instead of mock data.
3. Set up Firestore collections structure and security rules.
4. Configure Firebase Storage security rules.

## Active Decisions and Considerations

- We are using the "gorlea-snaps" Firebase project, which is now set as the active project.
- We're taking a step-by-step approach, completing and checking in after each task.
- Documentation will continue to be updated as the project evolves.
- We'll focus on one phase at a time, ensuring each component is properly implemented before moving on.
