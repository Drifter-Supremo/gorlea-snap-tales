## Active Decisions and Considerations

- We are using the "gorlea-snaps" Firebase project, which is now set as the active project.
- We're taking a step-by-step approach, completing and checking in after each task.
- Documentation will continue to be updated as the project evolves.
- We'll focus on one phase at a time, ensuring each component is properly implemented before moving on.
