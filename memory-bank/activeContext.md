## Active Decisions and Considerations

- We are using the "gorlea-snaps" Firebase project, which is now set as the active project.
- We're taking a step-by-step approach, completing and checking in after each task.
- Documentation will continue to be updated as the project evolves.
- We'll focus on one phase at a time, ensuring each component is properly implemented before moving on.
- Always use the Firebase SDK for storage operations to avoid CORS issues.
- Current Firebase Storage security rules are permissive for development; will need to be tightened for production.
- Using OpenAI GPT-4.1 model (gpt-4.1-2025-04-14) for story generation.
- OpenAI API key is stored in a separate .env.openai file for security.
