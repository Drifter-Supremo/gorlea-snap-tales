# Product Context: Gorlea Snaps

## Why This Project Exists

Gorlea Snaps was created to provide a creative, engaging way for users to generate personalized stories from their own photos using advanced AI. The project leverages the latest in AI (GPT 4.1) and cloud technologies to make storytelling accessible and fun for everyone, especially mobile users.

## Problems It Solves

- Lack of personalized, AI-driven storytelling experiences for casual users and photography enthusiasts.
- Difficulty in creating share-worthy, narrative content from personal images.
- Limited tools for combining image analysis and creative writing in a seamless, user-friendly way.

## How It Should Work

1. Users upload a photo via a mobile-first web interface.
2. Users select a story genre (Rom-Com, Horror, Sci-Fi, Film Noir).
3. The system analyzes the image using AI (GPT 4.1 Vision) to extract scene details.
4. A genre-specific prompt is crafted and sent to GPT 4.1 for story generation.
5. The generated story is displayed with options to save to favorites or share.
6. Users can authenticate (email/password, guest, or social login) to save and manage their stories.

## User Experience Goals

- Fast, intuitive, and visually appealing mobile-first design.
- Effortless image upload and preview.
- Clear genre selection with helpful descriptions.
- Quick, high-quality story generation with engaging formatting.
- Easy saving, sharing, and management of stories.
